# How to prepare data from CTD sensors
Repetitive operations are boring. It is wise to automate them. So I did.
Cleasning 160 files from CTD sensors takes +/- one day of boring work (8h). With this script work shortened to +/- 10s.

## General info

The purpose of the project was to remove irrcorect records from multiple CTD files. By irrcorect I mean records from the air or when sensor return to the surface. The effect of the automatic file cleaning is a bulk .csv file.

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.6.9
* numpy - version 1.16.4

## Status
Project is: _in done_
